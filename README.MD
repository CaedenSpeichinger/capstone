Api:

I developed a custom API for an Instagram clone, using Node.js and Express, designed to manage all the core functionalities of a social media platform. The API supports user registration and login, allowing users to create profiles, follow or unfollow other users, and update their profile information. It also includes endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts, enabling users to share photos or videos with captions. Additionally, the API allows users to comment on posts, like or unlike them, and manage these interactions efficiently.

To ensure security and seamless operation, the API follows RESTful principles and includes middleware for authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain features. The backend is structured to handle various user interactions and data management tasks, making it easy to integrate with a frontend application and providing a scalable foundation for building an Instagram-like social media platform.
